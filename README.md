# Pig Game
The Pig game is a simple dice game played with two or more players.  
The objective of the game is to score 100 points before your opponents, by rolling a single die to earn points.  
The game has two players, playing in rounds.  
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.  
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score.  
After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.  

## How to Play
Grab a single die and 2 or more players.  
Determine who goes first. We suggest doing a roll-off to determine who goes first.  
Each player rolls the die once, and the highest roll goes first, with play continuing clockwise.  
If players tie on the highest roll, the process is repeated until a winner is determined.  
On your turn, roll the die as many times as you wish, adding all roll results to a running total.  
If you roll a 1, all your round score gets lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.  
If you roll any other number, it gets added to your round score.  
You can choose to 'Hold' your round score, which gets added to your global score.  
The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.
